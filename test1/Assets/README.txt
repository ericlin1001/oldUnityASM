Hello!  My name is Jodon, indie developer and sole owner of Coding Jar Studios Inc.  Thanks for downloading my interactive tutorials.  You're just about there, here's what you need to do in order to get this running:

1.  Download the latest Unity game engine from:  http://unity3d.com/unity/download/
2.  Install and run the Unity game engine.
3.  Open this folder as the project folder.  There are three scenarios for doing this:
	a.  You've never run Unity before, in which case you will be asked which project to open upon start-up.  Browse to this folder.
	b.  You've used Unity before, in which case your last project will open.  Select the File menu, then Open Project.  Browse to this folder.
	c.  You've grabbed this from the Unity Asset Store.  In this case, create an EMPTY project before importing so your scripts do not conflict.
4.  Follow the instructions in the Tutorial Window
5.  Have fun, learn some things, and if you want to see more:  Like us on Facebook!  http://www.facebook.com/codingjar.  We'll take feedback there.

Thanks again!
